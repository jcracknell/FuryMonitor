0.3.0 - 2009-02-07
Fixed a bug where FuryMonitor would spew errors if there were no abilities available (ie. new Warrior character)
FuryMonitor now only loads if the player's character is a Warrior.
Added talent support such that ability damage reflects player talents (Unending Fury, Improved Whirlwind, Two-Handed Weapon Specialization, Dual Wield Specialization)
Re-implemented damage calculation for most abilities, I believe they are correct now.
Added Bloodsurge (instant Slam) to the rotation
Changed Bloodthirst to reflect changes in 3.0.3 (increased damage)
Added GetMainHandNormalizedSpeed() and GetOffHandNormalizedSpeed() methods to character abstraction (to support Mortal Strike, Devastate, etc)
Added support for overriding the behavior of Ability:IsAvailable() on a per-instance basis. This lets you control an ability's "availability" based on character buffs, etc (i.e. Bloodsurge).
Changing stances now correctly updates the rotation/ability damage immediately
Fixed a bug in Ability:GetCooldownDuration() that caused all abilities to take on the cooldown of any ability with a cooldown under the GCD (due to haste)
Removed rage dump frame entirely (heroic strike), as it was mostly useless and didn't work well anyways.
Converted most internal events to use the Observer pattern, removed all use of string keys for events
Fixed a bug that would cause errors when aquiring new abilities via talent changes
FuryMonitor now respects the immense power of Alt-Z and UI scale (all frames given a parent)
FuryMonitor is now liscenced under the WTFPL. If you are not familiar with the terms and restrictions imposed by the WTFPL, you can review them in the provided wtfpl.txt

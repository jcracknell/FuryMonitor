Fixed Whirlwind damage calculation so that attack power for the offhand weapon is no longer included when using a single weapon
Fixed stacking of rage indicators, previously they were under the ability frames, making them hard to see.
Bloodthirst no longer incorrectly applies Two-Handed Weapon Specialization to its damage
